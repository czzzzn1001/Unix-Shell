# Unix-Shell
A course project which simulates a basic Unix Shell
Supports directory commands like cd, pwd, ls
Text/file processing commands like cat
And Redirection and Piping commands like grep, wc, >
This program is able to continue even with error messages, just like Shell terminal.
These codes are for project demos only to show my coding logics and good practice.
